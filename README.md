# Time Based Reaction Game 
A single-player Reaction Time Measurement Game implemented on the Nexys DDR4 FPGA using Verilog HDL.
The project demonstrates practical usage of Finite State Machines (FSMs), timing logic, button synchronization, and 7-segment display control in a real-time digital system.
This project is aimed at ECE students learning RTL design, FPGA-based systems, and hardware verification.
